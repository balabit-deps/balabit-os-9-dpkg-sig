This dir contains a sample package, the dpkg-sig tempdir (named
debsigs-ng.sample) and all generated files.

What happened:
sample$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us
[...]
sample$ cd ..
examples$ dpkg-sig --sign-changes full --sign builder dpkg-sig-example_0.1_i386.changes
[...]

The used dpkg-sig version was slightly modified to make the temporary
files available.

dpkg-sig did the following things:
 1) Parse the .changes to get all binaries that need to be signed.
 2) Get the md5sums, sha1sums, sizes and names of all members of the
    deb (which is an ar archive)
 3) Write this information + some meta-data (Date, Role, Signer) in
    a RFC822-compliant format to debsigs-ng.sample/digests.
 4) Clearsign debsigs-ng.sample/digests, the signed version is in
    debsigs-ng.sample/digests.asc.
 5) debsigs-ng.sample/digests.asc is added to the deb (as new ar member)
    with an unique name reflecting the signing role.
 6) The new md5sum and size of the deb are put in the .changes file.
    As this invalidates an existing gpg signature, it is stripped.

[This is an optional feature of dpkg-sig:
 7) The .dsc is signed (an unsigned copy is in debsigs-ng/dsc, the 
    clearsigned copy is in debsigs-ng/dsc.asc and then moved to the
	original location)
 8) The new .dsc size and md5sum are put in the .changes file.
 9) The new .changes is signed (an unsigned copy is in debsigs-ng/changes,
    the clearsigned copy is in debsigs-ng/changes.asc and then moved
	to the original location)
