    fix POD by adding missing '=back'.

    debhelper and perl are needed during clean (lintian error).

  * Non-Maintainer Upload by Gunnar Wolf
  * Updated dependency on libconfigfile-perl to libconfig-file-perl,
    updated the invocation of ConfigFile to Config::File, to avoid the

  * HE
    - dpkg-sig:
      + Fix -k option so that the maintainer name is still retrieved from the
        gpg key. Patch from Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>, thanks. (Closes:
        #352727)
      + Remove --debug option (but leave code in so that manual code changes
        can reactivate the debug stuff). (Closes: #352723)
    - dpkg-sig.pod:
      + Update whole manpage, based on patch from Julian Gilbey
        <jdg@debian.org>. Thanks! (Closes: #352730)
    - examples/README:
      + Replace a left-over debsigs-ng.sample/md5sums.asc by digests.asc.
        Thanks for the note, Julian. (Closes: #342473)
    - debian/control: 
      + Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.2
      + Make me Maintainer, aba Co-Maint (mostly to get dpkg-sig on my QA
        overview page without co-maintained packages).

    - Make package lintian clean (includes overrides for empty files, they
      are empty for a reason).

dpkg-sig (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * HE
    - dpkg-sig:
      + [1-9A-F] describes possible hex digits not as well as [0-9A-F] (Yes,
        i'm a brainless idiot *sigh*). This should fix the Signer field for
        people using a 0x\S+0\S+ key id.
      + If passphrase caching enabled, we now check the passphrase at the
        beginning (and prompt again if something isn't ok)
      + Properly quote the $key and $maintainer arguments to gpg. (Closes:
        #308049)
      + Let ssh choose the username for a host if it wasn't specified in the
        URL, this allows the ssh config to do it's job. Thanks for the
        report, Marc. (Closes: #331122)
      + Handle ssh errors a *wee* *little* bit better. Almost no improvement,
        but enough to thank Marc for the report. (Closes: #331123)
      + Add missing chomps all over the place.
      + Replace '*changes' in a exec(grep) because that's crap and we know
        it (the .changes, not the crap).
      + Use another exit code when trying to verify and finding a bad
        signature. BAD SIG! GO TO YOUR ROOM! (Closes: #280559)
      + Check if an unknown key was used to create a signature when verifying
        a .deb. Output UNKNOWNSIG for those and exit with exitcode 3.
      + Don't use /usr/bin/perl -W, but /usr/bin/perl -w, which doesn't output
        stupid warnings.
      + die gracefully if a file couldn't be found (and don't end the show
        with a exit 0).

dpkg-sig (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * HE
    - dpkg-sig:
      + Change order of return values of get_md5sums.
      + Renamed get_md5sums to get_deb_digests.
      + Added get_deb_parts to allow faster listing of sigs.
      + Use md5sum(1) instead of Digest::MD5
      + Splitted the verify_deb into one sub per signature version,
        this should allow to add new versions more easily.
      + Implemented new signature format suggested by weasel (thanks for
        that!). We now sign sha1sums, md5sums and the size of every
        part in the deb archive. The new format also transports more
        meta-information (Signer, Date and Role). (Closes: #276557) 
      + Restructured dpkg-sig a bit to shorten the things done in main::
      + Added a lot of documentation as POD.
      + Added --remote-ssh-port|-o as cli option to allow people to
        specify the remote sshd port. (Closes: #271454)

    - debian/rules:
      + Generate dpkg-sig.7 from the POD documentation in dpkg-sig.

  * HE
    - urgency=high is IMHO needed, as #268376 would be a serious problems
      for developers using stable.
    - dpkg-sig:
      + Really really really work without ConfigFile in client mode. (Closes:
        #268376)
      + Don't include the damn CVS dirs in the source. (Closes: #263106)

  * HE:
    - dpkg-sig:
      + Move the use statement for ConfigFile in a way that we don't need
        it in --client mode. Useful if you want to install the thing in
        your home on a remote machine.
      + Add --help to give a brief help statement. (Closes: #257262)
      + Use value from Changed-By as default key when signing.

  * HE:
    - debian/control:
      + Update the Uploaders field, i'm a DD now!
      + Depend on perl, not perl-base.

    - debian/rules:
      + Fix a dh_md5sum problem, it excludes all files with DEBIAN in their
        path (and we have such files as examples)

    - dpkg-sig:
      + Fixed the "Signed deb *changes" output to print out the signed deb,
        not the changes file it was referenced from.
      + Be a bit more verbose when signing .dscs and .changes.
      + Verify deb before signing it. [This lead also to a change on the 
        return value of get_md5sums internally]

dpkg-sig (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * HE:
    - dpkg-sig:
      + Config file handling: Strip enclosing "s.
      + Die if gpg fails to sign. (Closes: #236183)
      + Rename get_md5_sums to get_md5sums.
      + Don't die when parsing a deb and reading a newline where we
        actually expected an ar header (can happen if people change
        stuff with vi). (Closes: #236185)
      + Cache md5sums in get_md5sums.
      + Don't ask for a passphrase if both -p/DPKGSIG_CACHE_PASS and
        -f are used (use the passphrase from the file specified with -f
        in that case)
      + Don't use die() if not needed for the weird stuff in eval{}.
        Created the cute _die() function to do that.
      + Added a "--remote-dpkg-sig" (also available as "-r") switch to
        allow users to specify where the dpkg-sig executable is. This
        is useful if you're not able to get the remote admin to install
        dpkg-sig.
      + Rearranged the main routine to drop duplicated code
      + Aliased add_file_to_ar_archive to add_sig_to_deb
      + add_sig_to_deb now starts a new ar archive if the file it should
        write to hasn't existed before.
      + New switches --get-hashes, --sign-hashes and --write-signature
        (also available as -h, -d and -w) The first one creates an
        archiv of hashes of a deb/changes, the second signs it
        (wherever you want) and the third one adds the signatures to
        the deb(s and corrects the changes file).
      + Make standard output more verbose.
      + Notice when people try dpkg-sig --sign foo --sign-changes *deb
        (--sign-changes uses an optional argument). Assume that this
        wasn't meant, choose yes for --sign-changes and process the files
        as other cli arguments.

    - dpkg-sig.1:
      + Document the new --remote-dpkg-sig stuff.
      + Document the new --get-hashes, --sign-hashes and --write-signature
        options.
      + Converted to POD, now available as dpkg-sig.pod

    - dpkg-sig.pod:
      + Added (converted from dpkg-sig.1)

    - debian/control:
      + Build-Depend on perl, we need pod2man to create the manpage.

    - debian/rules:
      + Create manpage from dpkg-sig.pod

    - dpkg-sig:
      + Fixed bug with cached passphrases leading to invalid signatures.
        We don't use GnuPG anymore (we now talk to GPG directly).
      + Added a "--gpgoptions" (also available as "-g") to allow users to
        give gpg arbitrary options.
      + Don't use only -r to check if a .dsc file is readable. Replaced
        with file_readable, which can handle a ssh://HOST:FILE path.
    - debian/control: Remove the libgnupg-perl suggestion.
    - dpkg-sig.1:
      + We don't need the GnuPG perl module to read the passphrase from a file.
      + We don't need the GnuPG to use the cached passphrase.
      + Document the new "--gpgoptions" stuff.

dpkg-sig (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * he:
    - Added new switch "--passphrase-file" (also available as "-f"). Allows
      signers to store their gpg passphrase in a file.
    - Now signs *changes and *dsc without the help of debsign. This is very
      useful for people signing many debs, as it uses the cached passphrase
      or the file with the passphrase.
    - Added example of the signing process, with a sample package and all
      temp files. Have fun.
    - debian/{control,rules}: Changed to install the examples. Now uses
      debhelper version 4.
   * aba:
     - added the new options to the man page, and added an usage example.

  * Added support to (re)sign changes files with debsign.
  * Fixed a bug in the remote signing code (content of changes files deleted)
  * Added support for a --debug switch, leading to a log of the communication
    between master and client in the remote /tmp/dpkg-sig.log. Use with care.
